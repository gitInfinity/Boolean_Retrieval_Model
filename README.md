# Boolean Retrieval Model

A **Boolean Retrieval Model** implementation in Python that processes text documents and enables efficient keyword-based search using boolean operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`). This project is designed for **Information Retrieval** tasks and demonstrates fundamental concepts of indexing and query processing.

### **Explanation:**  
- **Abstracts/** → Contains text documents that will be searched using Boolean queries.  
- **Gold Query-Set Boolean Queries.txt** → A predefined set of Boolean queries to test the model.  
- **Stopword-List.txt** → A list of common stopwords to exclude from indexing.  
- **main.py** → The main script that runs the Boolean Retrieval Model.  
- **README.md** → Documentation explaining the project, setup, and usage.

## 🔧 Installation Guide  

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:  

1. Clone the repository by downloading it from GitHub.  
2. Navigate to the project directory.  
3. Run the project using Python.  

---

## 📌 Usage  

1. Ensure you have the required documents inside the `Abstracts/` folder.  
2. Run the retrieval system by executing `main.py`.  
3. Enter a Boolean query. Example queries:  
   - Find documents containing **both** "data" and "science":  
     - `data AND science`  
   - Find documents containing **either** "AI" or "ML":  
     - `AI OR ML`  
   - Find documents containing "Python" **but not** "Java":  
     - `Python NOT Java`
